                <p>During my first year of Software Development, we worked on ALA as our main project. The goal was to create a website that met specific requirements and then pass it on to another team.</p>

                    <p>This was the first website I worked on collaboratively. At this point, I had a basic knowledge of frontend development and had just started working with backend technologies like PHP. This website is an online store where you can buy groceries. The project features a user-based system.</p>
