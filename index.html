        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>
            I'm Suzanne Boon, a 16-year-old student on the path to becoming a Software Developer. 
            Here I will share some information about myself and why I want to become a Software Developer. <br>
            My intrest for creating things began when I was just a child. 
            I always wanted to start new projects of any kind and make something from my own hands. 
            I liked being creative and decorating anything and everything.
            Since that time I got more intrest in the digital world instead, using it everyday like a lot of us. 
            Online I played a lot of games that big companies made or indie developers. 
            I was facinated and insipred at what some people could do, and I knew this was something I wanted to do too.
            After that, I started my journey of becoming a Software Developer in September 2023 by joining the course at MBO Rijnland. <br>
            I am excited to share my progress in this journey of becoming a Software Developer with you.
